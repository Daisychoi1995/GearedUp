# 🚴‍♀️ Geared Up

**Geared Up** is our final group showcase project, built from scratch by a team of six passionate developers.  
It was my first time collaborating in a group this big (I’d only worked in teams of 2 or 3 before), so this was a huge learning moment for me.

We focused on building a well structured full stack app with strong collaboration, testing practices, and a clean user experience.  
Despite the challenges, we found our rhythm—dividing tasks, aligning ideas, and communicating effectively.  
One thing I’m especially proud of? We wrote **43 tests** to keep our codebase rock solid 💪

This project really pushed me to grow—both in teamwork and technical skills—and I’m super proud of what we created together.
